    <h1> HTML MARKUP LANGUALE</h1>
    <img src="html.jpeg" align="right" height="200" width="300">
<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a
text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup language is a series of markings that tells web servers the
  style and structure of a document. </p>

<p>HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. Instead, with HTML, web users can create
  and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes. </p>

<p>This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS and JavaScript. </p>

  <h1>PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h1>
   <img src="python.jpeg" align="right" width="300" height="200">
  <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data
  structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well
  as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.</p><p>Python's simple, easy to learn syntax
  emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which
  encourages program modularity and code reuse.</p> <p></p> The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source
  or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>

  <h1>JAVA SOFTWARE LANGUAGE</h1>
<img src="java.jpeg" align="right" width="300" height="200">
<p>java is one of many high-level programming languages that use abstraction (reducing and factoring details) to create software
    for computers and many other electronic devices.  Compared to low-level programming languages, high-level programming
    languages use a mixture of natural language (any language used by humans) and typical computer terms to create an easier to
  understand and simpler form of programming.</p>  <p>Figures 1 and 2 show the difference in writing a simple program called “Hello
    World” in Assembly (a low-level programming language) and in Java.java is excellent lamguagge..</p>
<p>Like human languages, programming languages have different levels of writing difficulty; some are easy to write, while others
  require extensive computer knowledge to understand.</p>
