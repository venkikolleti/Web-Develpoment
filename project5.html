    <h1> HTML MARKUP LANGUALE</h1>

<div><p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a
text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup language is a series of markings that tells web servers the
  style and structure of a document. </p></div>

<div class="abc"><p>HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. Instead, with HTML, web users can create
  and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes.text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup language is a series of markings that tells web servers the

  <h1>PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h1>

 <div><p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data
  structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well
  as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.</p></div>
    <div class="abc"> <p>Python's simple, easy to learn syntax
  emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which

  <h1>JAVA SOFTWARE LANGUAGE</h1>

<div><p>java is one of many high-level programming languages that use abstraction (reducing and factoring details) to create software
    for computers and many other electronic devices.  Compared to low-level programming languages, high-level programming
    languages use a mixture of natural language (any language used by humans) and typical computer terms to create an easier to
  understand and simpler form of programming.</p> </div>
    <div class="abc"><p>Figures 1 and 2 show the difference in writing a simple program called “Hello
